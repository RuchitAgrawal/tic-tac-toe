Tic Tac Toe Project
Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, currently in Stage 1. It allows two players to play against each other on a grid of variable size (3x3, 4x4, 5x5).

Features
Variable Grid Size: The game supports boards of sizes 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5.

Theme Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes for better readability.

Winning Conditions: The game checks for wins in rows, columns, and diagonals.

Draw Condition: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Code Structure
The project consists of the following files:

index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the game board and UI.

styles.css: Contains CSS styles for layout, colors, and theme toggling.

script.js: Handles game logic, including player turns, winning conditions, and theme switching.

How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open index.html in a web browser to start the game.

Select the desired grid size from the options provided.

Click on cells to place your marks (X or O).

Future Development
AI Opponent: Implement a basic AI opponent for single-player mode.

Score Tracking: Add functionality to track and display player scores.

Multiplayer Mode: Develop a feature for online multiplayer.
